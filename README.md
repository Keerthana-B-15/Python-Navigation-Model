## Overview

The Python Navigation Model repository provides a framework for developing and testing navigation models using Python. This project involves setting up a virtual environment, installing necessary packages, and utilizing GeoJSON files to create navigation solutions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/Keerthana-B-15/Python-Navigation-Model.git 

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies:

    python -m venv venv 

Activate the virtual environment:

-   On Windows:
     
        venv\Scripts\activate 
    
-   On macOS/Linux:
   
        source venv/bin/activate 
    

### 3. Install Required Packages

With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

### 4. Collect GeoJSON Files

Place your GeoJSON files in the designated directory within the project. Ensure that these files are properly formatted and contain the necessary location data for your navigation model.

## Usage

After setting up the environment and collecting GeoJSON files, you can start developing and testing your navigation models.

Refer to the specific Python scripts in the repository for details on how to use them with your GeoJSON data.

Make sure to replace `navigation_model.py` with the actual entry point of your application if it's different.
